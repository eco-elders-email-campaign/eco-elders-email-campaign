Why are we doing this?
In terms of climate change, the 2024 US Election could have the greatest impact of any event this year. It will affect everyone, regardless of what country you live in. We don’t have time for a Trump administration bent on killing every policy designed to reduce America’s GHG emissions. You may have your own reasons for not wanting another Trump presidency and there are many. This project is about explaining to American voters how we feel and why this election is important to citizens across the globe.

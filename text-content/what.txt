What are we doing?
We’re writing personal letters to individuals in the United States in an attempt to open their hearts and do what’s best for their international neighbors. You will mail your letters the old fashioned way via your postal service. In this time of social media a hand written letter feels more personal and creates enough curiosity for someone to actually read it. You can’t hit delete.

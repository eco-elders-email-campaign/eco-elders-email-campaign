Letter writing guidelines
- Introduce yourself. Provide your first name, where you’re from and a little about yourself or your family. This will help form a personal connection. And if you’re very young or very old, let them know your age.
- Express your concern. Why are you worried enough about this election that you want to write them a letter? Who are you worried about and why? Focus on a single concern, the one that is most important to you. Explain how the issue affects you and your family.
- The ask. You’re asking them not to vote for Trump or to vote for Biden. The reason should be based on the concern you expressed in the letter. But make it personal. For example, “When you vote this year, please think about my son who doesn’t want to go to school because he’s so worried that one more drought might force me to sell our farm.” Or “I know Biden hasn’t done enough to stop the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but he’s been supporting Ukraine and I live in Kiev. Ukraine desperately needs US help to stop Putin.”

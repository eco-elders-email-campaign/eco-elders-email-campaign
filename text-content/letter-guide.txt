Letter format guidelines
- Try to keep it to one page, definitely no more than two.
- Be respectful and kind. You won’t know if your voter is a Democrat or a Republican so no ranting, denigrating Trump or questioning the integrity of anyone who would vote for Trump. It may feel good, but it won’t get your letter read. Pretend you’re writing to an old friend.
- Be honest. Don’t make things up that you think will make voters change their mind. It’s manipulative and it’s lying. Just don’t.
- Don’t provide a return address. You might not like the response you get.
- Edit! Read your letter several times out loud and read it to someone you trust. Set it down for a day and read it again.
- You only need to write one letter and then personalize each one you send with the person’s name.
- You can follow the sample letter format or create your own. The important thing is to write from the heart.
- You can ask for a vote for Biden to avoid vote splitting or simply ask them not to vote for Trump, or frame it however you want. It’s your letter.
